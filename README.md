### Object oriented programming 2 (OBJ2000)

This is a repo consisting of the programs as featured in the course book _Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures_ by _Y. Daniel Liang_. As per usual the "during-chapter" programs will be found with descriptive file names and the "after-chapter" programming exercises, referred to as "section" in the course book will be featured in the list beneath the __Objectives__-list with descriptive names and hyperlinks to its respective GitHub URL instead.

---

__Objectives__ 
> - To define methods with formal parameters
> - To invoke methods with actual parameters (i.e. arguments)
> - To define methods with a return value
> - To define methods without a return value and distinguish the differences between void methods and value-returning methods
> - To pass arguments by value
> - To develop reusable code that is modular, easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to maintain
> - To write a method that converts hexadecimals to decimals
> - To use method overloading and understand ambiguous overloading
> - To determine the scope of variables
> - To apply the concept of method abstraction in software development
> - To design and implement methods using stepwise refinement

#### Section classes

The __section__ classes are programming exercises. These come after each chapter instead of during the chapters as the __listing__ classes does. `*` and `**`denotes heightened difficulty according the course book editors.
